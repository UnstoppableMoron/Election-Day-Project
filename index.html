        <div class="two"><h2>History</h2>
        <p>The specific date of election days used to vary by state, but a federal law was passed in 1845 to set a single election day for the entire country. It was decided that early November would be a good time, because the country's mostly agrarian population would have just finished their harvest, but the weather would be mostly mild. Instead of having elections on a predetermined date, congress decided on a specific day of the week, two of which were already off the table. Most Americans at the time were devout Christians, and thus set aside Sunday as a day of rest and worship, and Wednesday in many areas was a market day, when farmers sold their crops in town. It was also agreed that a travel day was necessary, because the nearest polling location was likely miles away for people living in rural areas, and since cars weren't around yet, it could take a while to get there. This ruled out Monday and Thursday, as they couldn't be used as travel days due to the aforementioned reasons. This left Tuesday to be percieved as the best option. It was agreed that election day would be held on the first Teusday after the first Monday of November. The "after the first Monday" specification was added to prevent the election from falling on November 1st, which Christians saw as All Saints' Day.</p>
        <p>Although Tuesday was originally chosen for convenience, it is now seen as more of a hassle than anything. Today, less than 2% of Americans work in agriculture, and many people work on Tuesdays. Eventually, people began to propose that election day be moved to the weekend, or become a federal holiday. This hasn't happened as of yet, although it has also become possible for people to vote online or by mail, making the voting process significantly easier. </p>
